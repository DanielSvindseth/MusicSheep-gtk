# Music Sheep (gtk version)
Music Sheep is an audio player built on python and mpv. The program _should_ be compatible with Linux macOS and Windows, although I only test using Linux.
This rewrite of Music Sheep is written in python using gtk and libadwaita for the GUI, while using mpv as the audio backend. This version in developed in parallell to the original electron version, with the ultimate goal of becoming the main version since it doesn't require running a whole chromium session just to run, and thus should use a lot less resources.

I take no responsibility for poor code or issues with security causing any kind of damages. This is just a hobby project and not meant for any production-usage. **Do not use this if you are not okay with this.**
