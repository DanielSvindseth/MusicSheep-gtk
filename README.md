# Music-Sheep
Music Sheep is an audio player built on python and mpv. The program _should_ be compatible with Linux macOS and Windows, although I only test using Linux.


I take no responsibility for poor code or issues with security causing any kind of damages. This is just a hobby project and not meant for any production-usage. **Do not use this if you are not okay with this.**
